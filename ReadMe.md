# ANNs for Image Classification

## In this Assignment, you are tasked with designing ANNs that can classify handwritten digits from the MNIST10 dataset. You are allowed to use `Pytorch` for this Assignment. You will also be asked to write a report detailing the designs of your ANNs

## Steps to Run This :
1. Download and extract the MNIST.tar.gz inside the assigment dir
2. `$ make`  
 - To create the `virtual environment` and install modules in `requrements.txt`
3. the are 4 run section run1 to run4
`$ make run1` to run `Classifier_1.py` and etc.
# when executing the program you see the accuracy printed to show the network is training
# when done it will prompt you to enter the jpg path of the image you was to classify
