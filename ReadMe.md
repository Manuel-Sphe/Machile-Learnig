In this Assignment, you are tasked with designing ANNs that can classify handwritten digits from the MNIST10 dataset. You are allowed to use `Pytorch` for this Assignment. You will also be asked to write a report detailing the designs of your ANNs

## Steps to Run This :
1. Download and extract the `MNIST.tar.gz` inside the assigment dir
2. `$ make`  
 - To create the `virtual environment` and install modules in `requrements.txt`
3. the are 4 run section run1 to run4
`$ make run1` to run `Classifier_1.py` and etc.
When executing the program you see the accuracy printed to show the network is training
When done it will prompt you to enter the jpg path of the image you was to classify
